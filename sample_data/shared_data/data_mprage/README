Data acquisition
----------------
All images were acquired on a Siemens 7 T whole body scanner (Siemens Medical Solutions, Erlangen, Germany) using a head radio-frequency (RF) coil (Nova Medical, Wilmington, MA, USA; single transmit, 32 receive channels). In all acquisitions, we used dielectric pads (Teeuwisse et al., 2012).

For n=5 subjects (age range 24-30, 2 females, no medical condition), the MPRAGE data set consisted of: a T1w image using a 3D MPRAGE sequence (repetition time [TR] = 3100 ms; time to inversion [TI] = 1500 ms [adiabatic non-selective inversion pulse]; time echo [TE] = 2.42 ms; flip angle = 5°; generalized auto-calibrating partially parallel acquisitions [GRAPPA] = 3; field of view [FOV] = 224 × 224 mm2; matrix size = 320 × 320; 256 slices; 0.7mm isotropic voxels; pixel bandwidth = 182 Hz/pixel; first phase encode direction anterior to posterior; second phase encode direction left to right), a PDw image (0.7mm isotropic) with the same MPRAGE as for the T1w image but without the inversion pulse (TR = 1380 ms; TE = 2.42 ms; flip angle = 5°; GRAPPA = 3; FOV = 224 × 224 mm; matrix size = 320 × 320; 256 slices; 0.7mm iso. voxels; pixel bandwidth = 182 Hz/pixel; first phase encode direction anterior to posterior; second phase encode direction left to right), and a T2*w anatomical image using a modified MPRAGE sequence that allows freely setting the TE (TR = 4910 ms; TE = 16 ms; flip angle = 5°; GRAPPA= 3; FOV = 224 × 224 mm; matrix size = 320 × 320; 256 slices; 0.7mm iso. voxels; pixel bandwidth = 473 Hz/pixel; first phase encode direction anterior to posterior; second phase encode direction left to right).

Software
--------
The following software is used to convert the dicom data to nifti and to deface.
- dcm2nii (Chris Rorden's dcm2nii, 4AUGUST2014 (Debian) 64bit BSD)
- pydeface (version 2.0)
