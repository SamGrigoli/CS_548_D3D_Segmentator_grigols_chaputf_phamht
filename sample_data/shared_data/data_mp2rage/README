Data acquisition
----------------
All images were acquired on a Siemens 7 T whole body scanner (Siemens Medical Solutions, Erlangen, Germany) using a head radio-frequency (RF) coil (Nova Medical, Wilmington, MA, USA; single transmit, 32 receive channels). In all acquisitions, we used dielectric pads (Teeuwisse et al., 2012).

For n=4 subjects (age range 24-58, 2 females, no medical condition)  the MP2RAGE data set consisted of: 3D MP2RAGE data (TR = 5000 ms; TI1/TI2 = 900/2750 ms; TE = 2.46 ms; FA1/FA2 = 5°/3°; FOV = 224×224 mm2; matrix size = 320 × 320; slices = 240; 0.7 mm iso voxels) (Marques et al., 2010). For the same subjects, T2*w images were obtained with a multi-echo 3D GRE sequence (TR = 33 ms; TE1/TE2/TE3/TE4 = 2.53/7.03/12.55/20.35 ms; FA1 = 11°; FOV = 224 x 159 mm2; matrix = 320 x 227; slices = 208; 0.7 mm iso voxels). More details on the MP2RAGE data acquisition and the T2* estimation can be found in (Haast et al., 2016).

Software
