Notes
-----
The T2∗ maps were obtained from the GRE data using a mono-exponential fit (f(TE) = S0e-TE/T2∗).

ITK-Snap 3.6.0 is used to register the T2∗ maps to the MP2RAGE images (uni, T1, inv1, inv2), to create subcortical/cerebellum masks and to manually segment the gray matter. FSL 5.0.9 with BET v2.1 is used to create brain masks.

The 'ground truth' gray matter segmentations are labeled with version numbers depending on the number of iterations performed to get a subjectively satisfactory gray matter delineations. If there are further iterations to 'polish' the gray matter segmentations, these version numbers will be incremented.


Nature of the data
------------------
* gm_v??: gray matter ground truth; 1 for gray matter, 0 elsewhere
* artifact_mask_T2star: mask for susceptibility artifact-affected regions in T2*w image; 1 for artifact regions, 0 elsewhere
* brain_mask: mask for the brain; 1 for brain, 0 elsewhere
* brain_mask_nosub: mask for cerebrum, excluding cerebellum and brain stem; 1 for cerebrum, 0 elsewhere
* t2s_map_resliced_defaced: T2* map, obtained from the multi-echo 3D GRE images (see *me_gre_defaced.nii.gz)
